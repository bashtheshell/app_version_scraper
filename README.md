# App Version Scraper

The purpose of this repository is to **demonstrate** how one can retrieve the app version automatically from various sources that are publicly available to them. Rather than wasting time visiting the *App Store* or *Play Store* or downloading the binary files to the computer and execute the first phase of the installer to view the app version, we can either leverage the power of mobile app store's API and `curl` command-line tool to get the job done for us automatically.
